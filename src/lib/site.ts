      {
        q: "Will sun control film make my room darker?",
        a: "Modern nano-ceramic films are optically neutral — they don't tint your view grey or bronze. Visible light transmission of 50–70% means rooms stay bright while blocking infrared heat and UV. If you also want privacy, we have options that combine both.",

        q: "Does one-way film work at night?",
        a: "No — the one-way effect depends on the brightness difference between inside and outside. During the day the exterior is brighter, so the reflective coating blocks the view in. At night, when your interior lights are on and outside is dark, the effect reverses. For 24-hour privacy, pair one-way film on upper glass with frosted film on lower sections.",

        q: "Can I still see clearly from inside with one-way film?",

        q: "Does frosted film look like real etched glass?",
        a: "Very closely. Quality frosted film has a smooth, consistent texture that closely resembles acid-etched or sandblasted glass. The main visual difference at close range is the edge where film meets the frame — which we cut cleanly to minimise.",

        q: "Does regular window glass block UV rays?",
        a: "Standard float glass blocks most UVB rays (which cause sunburn) but transmits a significant portion of UVA rays — the longer-wavelength UV that causes skin ageing and fades furniture over time. UV protection film blocks up to 99% of both UVA and UVB.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will UV film make my room darker?",
        a: "Optically clear UV film has very low visible light absorption — the difference is barely perceptible. You get UV protection without making your space feel darker. If you also want heat control, we have combined films that add a slight neutral tint while keeping rooms bright.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can UV film protect my furniture and flooring from fading?",
        a: "Significantly. UV radiation is the primary cause of fading in wood floors, upholstery, curtains, paintings, and photographs. By blocking 99% of UV, the rate of fading slows dramatically — many customers report furniture looking as good as new 5+ years after installation.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is UV film useful even on north-facing windows?",
        a: "Yes — UV radiation reaches all windows, including north-facing ones in Mumbai, given the sun's arc across the sky. The intensity is lower, but UV exposure accumulates over time. For expensive furniture or artwork near any window, UV film is worthwhile.",
      },
      {
        q: "What's the difference between UV protection film and sun control film?",
        a: "UV protection film targets UV radiation and is optically clear — it doesn't significantly reduce heat. Sun control film rejects heat (infrared) and UV together, but usually has a tint that reduces visible light. For maximum protection of both home contents and comfort, we often recommend a combined film.",
